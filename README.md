## Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### Tools

- Visual Studio Code
- MacOS terminal
- Git and GitHub

## Outcome

- Used HTML5 for better readability and structure.
- Used CSS for styling.
- Used **Git** and **GitHub** for project management.
- Tried to maintain **clean code**.

## Summary

This was the very first project I started and I recently came back to apply more styling after learning more HTML/CSS. I think it is a good bar to show how far I've come in only 2 months. I hope to continue growing and add more Javasctript functionality to this.

### What I learned

- Gained a better understanding of **HTML** ans **CSS** foundations.
- Practiced aligning and containing a webpage using **flex**
- Utilized StackOverflow to help align items within containers.
- I used [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/) to help apply box shadow to containers on each recipe webpage.
