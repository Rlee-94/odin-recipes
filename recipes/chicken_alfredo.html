     <ol>
         <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the meat and cook until browned, about <strong>8-10 minutes.</strong> As the meat cooks, use a spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>
         <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about <strong>5 minutes.</strong></li>
         <li>Stir in tomato paste, red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about <strong>1 minute.</strong></li>
         <li>Pour in the water and stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for <strong>25 minutes.</strong> As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly.</li>
         <li>About <strong>15 minutes</strong> before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of water to boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions. Continuously check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
