          <h4>Start by making sauce</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the meat
              and cook until browned, about <strong>8-10 minutes.</strong> As
              the meat cooks, use a spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until
              softened, about <strong>5 minutes.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              Stir in tomato paste, red pepper flakes and cook, stirring
              continuously for about <strong>1 minute.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour in the water and stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt,
              and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low
              simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for
              <strong>25 minutes.</strong> As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce
              a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>
              About <strong>15 minutes</strong> before the sauce finishes
              cooking, bring a large pot of water to boil, and then cook pasta
              according to package directions. Continuously check for doneness a
              minute or two before the suggested cooking time.
            </li>
