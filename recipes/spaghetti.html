         <li>1/2 cup of shredded parmesean cheese</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <h4>Start by making sauce</h4>
     <ol>
         <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8-10 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>
         <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
         <li>Stir in tomato paste, red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
         <li>Pour in the water and stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly</li>
         <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of water to boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions. Continuously check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
     </ol>
